##description

[Nim language][1] bindings for [golib][2] - a library that (ab)uses gccgo to bring Go's channels and goroutines to the rest of the world.

##syntax comparison

| feature | Go | Nim |
|---------|----|-----|
| create channel | ``` c := make(chan int) ``` <br> ``` c2 := make(chan int, 1) ``` | ``` var c = make_chan(int) ``` <br> ``` var c2 = make_chan(int, 1) ``` |
| send value <br> to channel | ``` c <- 1 ``` | ``` c <- 1 ``` |
| receive value <br> from channel | ``` av := <-a ``` <br> ``` av, bv := <-a, <-b ``` | ``` var av = <-a ``` <br> ``` var (av, bv) = (<-a, <-b) ``` |
| channel type <br> (here in a function <br> parameter) | ``` func S(a, b chan uint) int { ``` | ``` proc S(a, b: chan[uint]): int = ``` |
| goroutine | ``` func f(x, y int) { ``` <br> ``` 	println(x, y) ``` <br> ``` } ``` | ```  ``` |
 

##API stability

The API is subject to change until the first version (0.0.1) is released. After this, backwards compatibility will become a priority.

##requirements

- [golib][2]
- [a Nim fork with the Go GC][3] if you want garbage collection in Nim

##build the benchmark and run tests

```sh
./autogen.sh
```
If you have a Nim branch with the Go GC in ../Nim\_gogc/:
```sh
./configure NIM=../Nim_gogc/bin/nim
```
Or with vanilla Nim and no GC:
```sh
./configure --disable-gogc
```
Run tests:
```sh
make check
```
Benchmark (compare it with the ones from golib):
```sh
make
/usr/bin/time -v ./benchmarks/cw_nim
```

##install

```sh
nimble install
```
